Hi, I’m Tom – welcome to my website!

If you're reading this, you’ve come from my CV, thanks for taking the time to dig a little deeper.

I think the idea behind this website is to give you a better sense of who I am beyond a single sheet of A4. I’ve not done anything like this before, but I'll give it a go.

I’ll be writing [Blog](/blog/) posts (when I have time), covering everything from things I find interesting to things I’ve done and think are worth saying a few words about. Hopefully, through reading those, you’ll start to build a better picture of who I am and how I think.

Another reason for putting this site together is the [Projects](/projects/) section, where I’ll talk about various projects I’ve worked on, both academic and personal. I’ll cover what I enjoyed (and didn’t), the skills I picked up along the way, and generally anything I think is worth commenting on.

Enjoy :) 

n.b. this website is a WIP
