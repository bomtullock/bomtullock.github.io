This project is my favourite to date. I think the autotelic nature of it is something I find deeply satisfying. Taking an engineering problem such as *'How can we model the heat distribution of a heatsink'*, and then developing a finite element model from first principles and implementing that into working code to solve the problem I think is very cool.
