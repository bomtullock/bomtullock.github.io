***This post is about my personal experience as a student during the explosive rise of AI in the past couple of years. It’s not a piece about how policy should handle AI.***

### Introduction 

As a recent university graduate, I started my degree when the vast majority of students, including myself, didn't know what AI or a Large Language Model (LLM) was. Four years later, half your coursemates probably pay for a ChatGPT subscription and the other half have access to one. I’ve seen first-hand just how rapidly AI has found its way into university life and I think that puts me in a somewhat unique position to share some honest thoughts on the opportunities and challenges it brings for students today. {% cite kosmyna2025brainchatgptaccumulationcognitive %}
