***This post is about my personal experience as a student during the explosive rise of AI in the past couple of years. It’s not a piece about how policy should handle AI.***

### Introduction 

As a recent university graduate, I started my degree when the vast majority of students, including myself, didn't know what AI or a Large Language Model (LLM) was. Four years later, half your coursemates probably have a ChatGPT subscription. I’ve seen first-hand just how rapidly AI has found its way into university life and I think that puts me in a pretty unique position to share some honest thoughts on how it’s being used, and the opportunities and challenges it brings for students today. test test <d-cite key="kosmyna2025brainchatgptaccumulationcognitive"></d-cite>
